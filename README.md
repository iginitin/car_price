# Car Price Prediction
<h3>Auto company</h3> <hr>
<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Requirements</h3><br>

An Auto company is doing the survey and trying to do the benchmarking of price of the New models / Variants. they would be launching in future based upon the various parameters of Vehicle.<br>

•   Supervised predictive model need to be created which can predict the price of the Vehicle based upon the various attributes of the Vehicle.<br>
•	Build the Multivariate Linear regression model, verifying the assumptions of the linear regression hold true.<br>
•	Models should be evaluated based on the various metrics (Rsquare, Adjusted R Square).<br>
•	Model accuracy should be high but at the same time model should not be overfitted.<br>
•	Plots need to be constructed to check the assumptions of the Regression.<br>
•	Feature Selection needs to done, which will tell the impact of feature is increasing the price and which feature has the diminishing impact on the price. Features with their respective importance score needs to be tabulated<br>


<h3>Analysis</h3><br>
The data is ordinal, nominal as well as categorical. To analyze the data, various data processing techniques like Label Encoding. For training the data and predicting the target, algorithms used Linear Regression.

Steps we performned:<br>
1) Data cleansing <br>
2) One hot encoding <br>
3) Lable Encoding <br>
3) Drop unwanted columns <br>
4) Split data into training test sets and <br>
5) Build the model <br>





<h3>Summary</h3><br>
The project is done with the purpose of:
Build the Multivariate Linear regression model

The following steps are carried out:

Importing the data, necessary libraries, & exploring the data to look for missing values.
Selecting the features for analysis, label encoding the ordinal column and splitting the data into test & train.
Training the data using Linear Regression algorithms and checking the MSE, RMSE and MAPE to find out model accuracy.



<h3>Results</h3><br>
We have observed that Performance of the model is 85.08 % <br><br>
